# **Kamorale!**

#### **thank you for stumbling upon my page.**

My name is Aichen Cholymay Rayphand and I am from the beautiful islands of Chuuk state which is part of the Federated States of Micronesia, but was born in Oahu, Hawaii. I am currently in my second year of college majoring in Data Science (DSAV) at Chaminade University of Honolulu. I love everything "art", whether it's music, poetry, history, tradition, dances, etc. Art allows me to fully express myself , my thoughts, and my beliefs. I have always wanted to try new things, and this website is just the beginning!!
